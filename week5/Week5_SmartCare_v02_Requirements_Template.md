1. Problem and scope

The SmartCare community‑clinic currently using spreadsheets and paper records to manage patients and appointment data. This management style causing duplicate bookings, hard‑to‑find patient records, inconsistent appointment status, poor visibility of doctor to availability and no reliable appointment history.
Scope: build a simple software system to manage patient medical records, practitioner details and clinic appointment.
Out of scope: Online patient self‑booking, SMS verification, online payment, facial recognition
